this 4x4 from russia is a fraction of the price of a new land rover .off-road, the niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears .but, forget luxuries because the niva is an unabashed frills-free zone .a highly capable, ruftytufty 4x4 from russia — for a fraction of the price of a new land rover.it's a confident charmer that stands out from the crowd, with high suspension, pressed steel wheels, soviet-style looks and real rarity value. expect to get gawped at: someone offered to buy mine on its second trip out. always fun.now available in the uk from niva imports through its dealer, bb motors, in corby, northamptonshire (01536 202207, lada4x4.co.uk).on the road, the basic 1.7-litre petrol engine (your only option) is deafeningly noisy, but tolerably smooth. power steering, manageable dimensions and a tight turning circle make it reasonably practical for the supermarket or school run.the seats are comfy and thanks to a high driving position and large wing mirrors, all-round visibility is good. top speed is 91 mph.off-road, the niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears, differential lock and a sturdy monocoque construction. it is lighter and more sprightly in the mud than many big-name utility 4x4s, with 220mm ground clearance, a 600mm wading depth and a climbing ability of up to 58 per cent. tall, slender tyres give it an added advantage when things get mucky.you won't have to agonise over pages of extras... they're more or less nonexistent. this is a very basic utility vehicle, after all.choose in white, blue, green or red, then decide whether you'd like the snorkel or snow plough (really) attachments. an lpg option is available for an extra £999 — but you lose boot space.reasonable fuel economy at 33mpg and affordable to insure — once you've explained exactly what it is. meets euro 5 emissions standards. the heated blower, presumably designed with siberia in mind, has plenty of muscle for icy winter mornings.also available in a compact van format (£10,590, excluding vat and road tax).spartan on the inside. forget luxuries such as radios, cup-holders, central locking and electric windows — the niva is an unabashed frills-free zone. the upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior is easy to mop down after a day in the mud, and there's not much to break or go wrong.there are only four seatbelts and a slightly pokey boot.don't trust the petrol gauge, which regularly aims to deceive.no warranty is offered as standard — although a two-year plan is coming soon — and spares may need to be imported (bb motors will assist).only available in lefthand drive — unless you put in an order for more than 500 of them!shhhh! you didn't hear it from me. but patriotic russian president vladimir putin made a big play of driving a lada niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a german engine.

this is the third part of our major good health series on dementia .we look at ways to help minimise the impact of memory problems .for example, we need just as much sleep as we get older .the problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep .when the short-term memory starts to go, it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day, such as whether they've had breakfast, or showered, or spoken to someone.it can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day. writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes, which can help slow down future decline.create a memory hub - that is, a central place in the home, perhaps the dining room table or a desk, where important notes, car keys, house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept. put things here that you want to be able to find quickly. get into the habit of having everything in this one place rather than having things scattered about the home.get a whiteboard or blackboard - that can be used to record a timetable of what needs to be done each day that week. things that get done can be ticked off. it is another way to show what has been done, but also shows what remains to be done.label doors, drawers, cupboards and cabinets to avoid confusion about what goes where.have a list of the numbers of key people by the phone - your gp and other care professionals, carers, family and reliable friends.have a daily newspaper delivered - it is a simple way of keeping aware of what is happening in the world and is a useful reminder of that day's date.when showering or having a bath, establish a routine as a reminder of whether your hair has been washed. for example, move the conditioner and shampoo from one side of the bath to the other once you've used them.eat regular meals. while other body cells can take fuel from elsewhere, the brain relies on a good supply of glucose from the blood. that's why skipping a meal can affect reasoning, cognition and memory.in the early stages of dementia, begin a reminiscence book to act as a reminder of key events in that person's life and who people are. it's a nice thing for the person with dementia and a loved one to do together. include pictures and snippets of information and date and label every entry.
